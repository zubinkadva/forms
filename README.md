# forms

## When?
Fall 2017, Florida Institute of Technology, United States

## What?
* A web portal for university forms
* Implemeted only one form since I was given a time constraint of a few hours (??)
* Was going to be taken over by my seniors since I had my final exam the next day (?!), but later scrapped since there was no one to work on it and I had completed my contract

## Technologies?
* PHP (Laravel v5.4)
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

Alternate github repo [here](https://github.fit.edu/zkadva2016/forms)

_This repository does not contain any code, simply this lame readme; but nevertheless, since I have done work, it is part of my github repositories_
